CMSC 25025 / STAT 37601: Machine Learning and Large-scale Data Analysis

This is the repository for codes I wrote for assignments CMSC 25025 class at The University of Chicago. There were five homeworks and one final project. All codes are written in Python and saved as .ipynb files. These can be opened on Jupyter notebook.  
Most of the codes are working on specific dataset. While all required datasets are included in the corresponding folder, MNIST_TR.npy for homework 4 and wiki-text.txt for homework 5 could not be committed to Git due to large file sizes.    
\newline  
Below are the topics of each assignment.

**Homework 1:** K-means clustering on randomly generated data / Analysis of U.S. Presidents' SOU via linear regression  
\newline  
**Homework 2:** TF-IDF analysis of SOUs / Analysis of handwritten digit images via (i) PCA, (ii) k-means, (iii) spectral clustering, and (iv) classification by logistic regression  
\newline  
**Homework 3:** Analysis of beer review data via logistic regression (focus on usage of logistic and hinge loss + direct implementation of SGD procedure)  
\newline  
**Homework 4:** Dictionary learning on images based on sparse representation (including direct implementation of SGD procedure) / Convolutional neural network for recognition and classification of handwritten digit images  
\newline  
**Homework 5:** Word2Vec analysis of Wikipedia corpus  
\newline  
**Final Project:** usage of handwritten *letter* images for training embeddings of a convolutional neural network and classifying images of handwritten *digits* (Inspired by an academic paper *A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations* by Ting Chen, Simon Kornblith, Mohammad Norouzi, and Geoffrey Hinton)
