This repository has my work for the programming portion (Q4 and Q5) of the homework 1 of CMSC 25025 / STAT 37601: Machine Learning and Large-scale Data Analysis.Running codes of Q5 would require a .json data file, which is also included in the corresponding folder. Python files of each question are the original version of codes I wrote and tested. Actual submission of homework is done through .ipynb files (for Jupyter notebook).
